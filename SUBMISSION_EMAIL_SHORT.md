Subject: Coding Assessment Submission - Mini Wallet Dashboard

Dear Wunmi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to submit my completed coding assessment for the Frontend Engineer position.

**GitHub Repository:**
https://github.com/divo662/mini-bank-wallet

**Live Deployment:**
https://mini-bank-wallet-qg5r.vercel.app/

**Project Summary:**
I have successfully built a Mini Wallet Dashboard application that meets all specified requirements. The application is a fully functional React + TypeScript application featuring:

- Transactions list with running balance calculations
- Transfer form with comprehensive validation and optimistic updates
- Advanced filtering (category, merchant, date range)
- Pagination system
- Fund Wallet functionality with PIN verification
- Fully responsive design (360px to desktop)
- Accessibility features (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Security best practices (no sensitive data logging, generic error messages)

**Technical Stack:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Zustand for state management
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for routing
- localStorage for data persistence

The application is production-ready, well-documented, and follows modern React best practices. All code is type-safe, includes comprehensive error handling, and has been successfully deployed to Vercel.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
