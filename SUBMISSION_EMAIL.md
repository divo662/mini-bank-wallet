Subject: Coding Assessment Submission - Mini Wallet Dashboard

Dear Wunmi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to submit my completed coding assessment for the Frontend Engineer position.

**GitHub Repository:**
https://github.com/divo662/mini-bank-wallet

**Live Deployment:**
https://mini-bank-wallet-qg5r.vercel.app/

**Project Overview:**
I have successfully built a Mini Wallet Dashboard application that meets all the specified requirements. The application is a fully functional React + TypeScript application with the following key features:

**Core Features Implemented:**
- Transactions list with date, merchant, category, amount (credit/debit), and running balance
- Transfer form with validation (positive decimals, max 2 decimal places, sufficient balance check)
- Optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback on error
- Advanced filtering by category, merchant, and date range
- Pagination system (10 items per page)
- Real-time balance calculations
- Responsive design (360px to desktop)
- Accessibility features (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **State Management:** Zustand for lightweight, type-safe state management
- **Routing:** React Router with minimal routes (/, /transfer, /fund-wallet, /transactions)
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- **Validation:** Custom validation functions with real-time feedback
- **Data Persistence:** localStorage with JSON file fallback

**Security & Best Practices:**
- No sensitive data logged to console
- Generic error messages that don't expose internals
- Form validation before submission
- Disabled buttons during processing to prevent double submission
- TypeScript for type safety

**Additional Features:**
- Fund Wallet functionality with PIN verification
- Transaction detail modals
- Success modals with progress indicators
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design with collapsible sidebar

The application is production-ready, fully responsive, and follows modern React best practices. All code is well-structured, type-safe, and includes comprehensive error handling.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
